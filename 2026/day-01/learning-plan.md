# Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

# My DevOps Learning Plan
My current role is PHP developer and i want switch to DevOps and Cloud.

# Goals for the Next 90 Days-
1) Deploy a production-grade application on Kubernetes
2) Build an automated CI/CD pipeline for application delivery
3) Provision and manage cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code

# Core DevOps skills I want to build -
1) Linux system administration & troubleshooting
2) CI/CD pipeline design and automation
3) Containerization and Kubernetes operations

# Weekly Time Budget -
1) Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours per day
2) Weekends: 4–6 hours total
3) Total: ~14–16 hours per week

# 1. What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

   DevOps is culture + midsent + set of practices + tools that helps to develoment teams (Dev)
   and Operation teams (Ops) works together to:
   1) Bulid software faster
   2) Deploy it safely & repeatedly
   3) Keep it stable, secure, and scalable
     
# 2. Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
   
   1) I am starting to learn DevOps and Cloud because modern software development is no longer just about writing code
   it’s about how efficiently,securely, and reliably that code is delivered and scaled.
   2) DevOps helps me understand the end-to-end lifecycle of an application, from development to deployment and monitoring.
   
# 3. Where do you want to reach?

   I want to grow into a skilled DevOps & Cloud Engineer who can design, automate, deploy, and manage scalable, secure, and highly available systems.
   
   # My goal is to:
   1) Master cloud platforms (like AWS/Azure/GCP)
   2) Build end-to-end CI/CD pipelines
   3) Automate infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
   4) Work with containers and orchestration tools
   5) Ensure monitoring, reliability, and security in production systems.

# 4. How you will stay consistent every single day?
   I will stay consistent by building habits and systems, not relying on motivation.
  # My approach:
  
   1.  Daily small goals:
   1) I’ll focus on learning or practicing at least one small DevOps/Cloud concept every day
   2) 2 to 2.5 hrs daily study
   3) Hands-on practice

   2. I’ll apply what I learn immediately by:
   1)  Writing scripts
   2)  Creating cloud resources
   3)  Building mini-projects

   3. Follow a structured roadmap:
   1)  I’ll stick to a defined learning path instead of jumping between tools
   2)  This avoids confusion and burnout
   
   4. Track my progress:
   1)  I will maintain A learning log / notes
   2)  GitHub commits
   3)  Daily or weekly checklists
      
   5. Accept imperfect days:
   1)  On busy days, I’ll still do something small—reading docs, revising notes, or watching one short video
   2)  Consistency matters more than intensity
      
   6. Community & accountability:
   1) I’ll engage with learning communities and mentors
   2)  Sharing progress publicly keeps me accountable
